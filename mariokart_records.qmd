The data here is based on the tidytuesday Dataset for [Mario Kart 64 World Records](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-05-25). There are two different sources of data, being one for world records and one for the drivers, or players, associated with these records.


```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("readr")
library("dplyr")
library("magrittr")
records <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/records.csv')
drivers <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/drivers.csv')
```

```{r}
three_laps <- records %>% filter(type == "Three Lap") %>% 
```

```{r}
# Which countries prefer which tracks?
driver_simple <- drivers %>% 
  group_by(player) %>% 
  .[, c(1,2,3,6)] %>% 
  unique()

driver_simple$nation <- as_factor(driver_simple$nation)

func <- function(x) return(mutate(x, num = count(x, nation)))

country <- records %>% left_join(driver_simple, by = "player") %>%
  .[, c(1,4,5,12)] 

country %<>%
  group_by(track, nation) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  ungroup()
