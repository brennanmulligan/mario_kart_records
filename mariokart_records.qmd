The data here is based on the tidytuesday Dataset for [Mario Kart 64 World Records](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-05-25). There are two different sources of data, being one for world records and one for the drivers, or players, associated with these records.


```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("readr")
records <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/records.csv')
drivers <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/drivers.csv')
```

```{r}
three_laps <- records %>% filter(type == "Three Lap") %>%
